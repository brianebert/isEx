				Hi, I'm Brian.  I’m a member of the public defined by Martin Gurri in <em>“The Revolt of The Public 
				and the Crisis of Authority in the New Millennium,”</em> 2018.  You probably are too.  I was a reader early on, 
				and that was about all it took.  A great story I was 
				told in a red brick school house was bullshit.  Leaders lied.  Then it got worse.  Childhood fear 
				of annihilation crumbled into kleptocracy.  Could a 28 year old single congressman 
				being paid more than 3 2/3 times her district's average household income renounce her congressional 
				health plan until all 325 million of us receive it?  If not you, then who, aoc?  535 of us clearly feel entitled to 
				much of which few of their constituents can attain.  We selected an obvious liar 
				as the face of our nation.  What is the sound of a national admission of 
				powerlessness to govern?
			</p>
			<p class="storyTelling">
				But who needs kleptocrats?  Google owns our search history and splits our communication 
				with Facebook.  Amazon owns our shopping habits.  Entertainment choices and movements are recorded by a 
				handful of others.  Threat from artificial intelligence?  How closely held are the datasets capable to 
				train deep learning systems?  Who needs kleptocrats when we give ourselves away like manhattan for a 
				bag of beads, free email and social aprobation?
			</p>
			<p class="storyTelling">
				While our financial and government leaders who lead us were leading us through 2008, foreclosing on the 
				homes of millions while growing our money supply by 50% in five years to purchase 
				wasting assets from the culpable, something new appeared.  Toy money?  Why not?  Easier 
				to understand than a credit default swap.  It keeps accounts of itself.  Anyone can have a 
				copy.  All of the copies agree.  Trust exists without investing it in people.  What if that trust can 
				extend beyond peer to peer cash?  What if that trust can be invested in any of the documents we share  
				between us?  I can do something constructive about accounting and documents.  Sexy, huh?  Read on.
			</p>
			<p class="storyTelling">
				Gurri describes our revolt as a natural response to explosion of information.  If he is right, then we should 
				expect our revolt to continue inexorably.  Gurri highlights dangers of nihilism, and we all see its 
				predations.  The story I was told in the red brick schoolhouse may have been bullshit, but it was a good 
				story.  For want of a better idea we could simply tell that story, tell it truthfully, and make sure it applies 
				to everyone.  I present some primitive tools that can be used to construct transparent document systems, 
				communicate authentically, and exchage value, in a space where we each may 
				remain natural sovereigns of all pertaining to ourselves.  Any more may depend on you.
